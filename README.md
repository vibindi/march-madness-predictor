Based on teams records, tournament seeds, tournament round and other statistics, predict tournament outcome by predicting each individual game outcome

### potential problems

- what exactly are good indicators?
- tournament upsets happen quite often, how to determine
- do i include stats like number of players in top 25?
- what if a team has not played in the tournament before?
